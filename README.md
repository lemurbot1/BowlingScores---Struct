# BowlingScores---Struct

The purpose of this program is to collect the names and scores of bowlers from BowlingScores.txt and then calculate the average score for each bowler based on 5 game plays. Finally, the program will print out the names, scores, and calculated averages for each player. This program is a modified version of the original to include a structure.
